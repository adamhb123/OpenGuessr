# Serverside

Here we perform server-side operations generally only requested by code in the [routes](../routes) directory, although
other operations and files may also exist here should it seem logical.

## What should be in here?

Functions that perform server-side operations in response to client requests. Most of the files in here will have a 
[routes](../routes) counterpart of the same name that calls the methods stored in these files. As stated above, however,
this may not _always_ be the case.
